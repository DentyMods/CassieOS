# **CassieOS**

## 9/30/2021, Since im brand new with making a linux OS I figured some stuff out, This OS will be based on Ubuntu-mini since making the OS from scratch is toooooooo much work, Sadly Ubuntu-mini only goes to ubuntu 18.04 which isn't a massive issue, Also CassieOS will be 64bit (so amd64, x86_64), I'm going to mess around and test out this ubuntu-mini and see if it will work for this project, Wish me luck! -Denty


## FAQ


### **What is CassieOS?**
- CassieOS is a linux OS based on (still deciding, *Most likely Ubuntu*) with a [SCP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) theme with the C.A.S.S.I.E system. (*Central Autonomic Service System for Internal Emergencies*)

### **What is SCP?**
- SCP is a secret organization that stands for Secure, Contain and Protect, They are responsible for containing anomalies that break the natural laws. Some SCP's are safe and others are known as "keter" that are extremely dangerous such as [SCP-106](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-106), A good way to describe the SCP foundation is as follows, "We die in the dark so that you may live in the light" ~~totally not originally from assassins creed~~

### **Omg is the SCP foundation real?**
- Yes, They are 100% real, The F.B.I is most likely on their way to arrest you for seeing this.

### **Why did you create this?**
- I got this idea from kitrod when he posted a really cool cassie concept *image below*.

### **ETA for release?**
- ETA 5 Years, No but there will be a few builds before a official stable release, I plan on releasing a beta build in the next few weeks hopefully.

### **Is there a Discord?**
- Yes, We will be using our SCP:SL ServerHosts Discord which has my 2 other SCP:SL projects (SCPSL FAQ project and a dedicated server for server hosts)

### **Is this going to be a really big project and long time supported?**
- It would be cool if this project gets heavily supported by people, If it does I will try my best to keep this OS alive and updated!
