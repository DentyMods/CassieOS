## FAQ


### **What is CassieOS?**
- CassieOS is a linux OS based on Ubuntu 20.04 with a [SCP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) theme with the C.A.S.S.I.E system. (*Central Autonomic Service System for Internal Emergencies*)

### **Is this efficient?**
- Sadly no its really not, I was planning on making this OS with the barebones of Ubuntu and adding and making my own stuff to the OS but for right now I changed my mind, I could do that but it would be time consuming and honestly I do plan on doing that when I can find people to help me out that are somewhat experienced with this type of stuff, As of right now CassieOS is just Ubuntu 20.04 with modifications and I dont know how far we can do with modifications with our program Cubic but I will try to modifiy squashfs and see what I can do with my testing builds, The current CassieOS is just for the memes and a cool thing to show off to your friends if you want, When the time comes for a real fully built OS from me I will either make a new repository called "New CassieOS" or just gonna overwrite this one.

### **What is SCP?**
- SCP is a secret organization that stands for Secure, Contain and Protect, They are responsible for containing anomalies that break the natural laws. Some SCP's are safe and others are known as "keter" that are extremely dangerous such as [SCP-106](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-106), A good way to describe the SCP foundation is as follows, "We die in the dark so that you may live in the light" ~~totally not originally from assassins creed~~

### **Omg is the SCP foundation real?**
- Yes, They are 100% real, The F.B.I is most likely on their way to arrest you for seeing this.

### **Why did you create this?**
- I got this idea from kitrod when he posted a really cool cassie concept *image below*.

### **ETA for release?**
- ETA 5 Years, No but there will be a few builds before a official stable release, I plan on releasing a beta build in the next few weeks hopefully.

### **Is there a Discord?**
- Yes, We will be using our SCP:SL ServerHosts Discord which has my 2 other SCP:SL projects (SCPSL FAQ project and a dedicated server for server hosts) discord.gg/qZ97fZjJeq
