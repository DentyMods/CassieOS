# **CassieOS**

## FAQ


### **What is CassieOS?**
- CassieOS is a linux OS based on (still deciding, *Most likely Ubuntu*) with a [SCP](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) theme with the C.A.S.S.I.E system. (*Central Autonomic Service System for Internal Emergencies*)

### **What is SCP?**
- SCP is a secret organization that stands for Secure, Contain and Protect, They are responsible for containing anomalies that break the natural laws. Some SCP's are safe and others are known as "keter" that are extremely dangerous such as [SCP-106](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-106), A good way to describe the SCP foundation is as follows, "We die in the dark so that you may live in the light" ~~totally not originally from assassins creed~~

### **Omg is the SCP foundation real?**
- Yes, They are 100% real, The F.B.I is most likely on their way to arrest you for seeing this.

### **Why did you create this?**
- I got this idea from kitrod when he posted a really cool cassie concept *image below*.
